# Configuring a CodeQL language matrix

_Configure your CodeQL workflows with a language matrix to simplify your code scanning workflows_

</header>

## Welcome

In this course we will explore how you can configure CodeQL using configuration files. During this course, we will show you how to add a query pack to a CodeQL configuration file, as well as configure your workflow to reference that configuration file.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, security engineers, open source maintainers.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll show you how to configure your workflow to use a language matrix. We will also cover the autobuild action for compiled languages. This will allow you to have a single code scanning workflow that covers all the languages in your repository.
- **What you'll build**: A secure software development pipeline that has been tuned to your project's specific needs.
- **Prerequisites**: Knowledge of how the context and expressions work in workflows. You can learn more about this in the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- **How long**: This course is 2 steps long and takes less than 30 minutes to complete.
